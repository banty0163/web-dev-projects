# 🌐 Web Dev Projects

A curated collection of web development mini‑projects—each one a bite‑sized learning brick that helped me grow as a developer!

---

## 🚀 What This Is

This repo is my personal playground of front‑end and full‑stack creations. From pure HTML/CSS builds to JavaScript‑powered widgets (and maybe even a PHP/MySQL app in there!), this is my code journey in action.

---

## 📂 Project Highlights

- **JavaScript Games & Tools** – Fun and interactive mini apps like clocks, counters, quizzes, etc.
- **HTML/CSS Templates** – Neat landing pages, forms, and responsive layouts.

Each project lives in its own folder with its **own README**, where I explain what it does and how I built it.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Front‑end:** HTML5 | CSS3 | JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Dev Tools:** VS Code, live‑server / XAMPP, Git & GitHub

## 🧭 How to Explore

```bash
# Clone the collection
git clone https://github.com/banty0163/web-dev-projects.git

# Choose a project folder
cd web-dev-projects/<project-name>

# If it's pure front-end:
open index.html  # in your browser
# or use live-server in VS Code for auto‑reload

# If it's got PHP + MySQL:
# 1. Install and start XAMPP or WAMP
# 2. Copy project folder into your local web-root (e.g. htdocs/)
# 3. Start Apache & MySQL
# 4. Visit http://localhost/<project-folder> in your browser
